Sorting application for use after data recovery (lost file structure.)

The executable should be run for the first time from an empty directory, as it will create its own structure.
After that, files that need sorting should be placed in Source/, and the executable should be run again.

File names and any structure will be lost, as files will be sorted by filetype into folders. Any files with
unsorted or unknown filenames or filetypes will be placed in "SourceUnhandled."

The program can accept two flags;
    `-postclean` will remove any source files after the program completes
    `-nomaxes` mostly a test flag, will ignore any existing sorted files, can save very minimal time
	
To add a new file type to the sorter:
	- programWideVars.h will need to be edited using the follow steps:
		- Add the file type to the array near the top of the file corresponding to the type of file (Video, Pic, Audio or Document)
		- Change the constant int below the array to be the same as the length of the array
		- Update the "visual file structure" in buildFileStructure.h
