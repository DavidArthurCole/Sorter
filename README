Sorting application for use after data recovery (lost file structure.)

The executable should be run from an empty directory, as it will create its own structure.
File names and any structure will be lost, as files will be sorted by filetype into folders. Any files with
unsorted or unknown filenames or filetypes will be placed in "SourceUnhandled."

The program can accept two flags;
    `-postclean` will remove any source files after the program completes
    `-nomaxes` mostly a test flag, will ignore any existing sorted files, can save very minimal time
